Ludum Dare 46:
- THEME : Keep it alive
    * Easy, just keep the player alive. maybe make something defense-able.
    * Mid, Capute enemies? throw a net over them and drag them to safe spot?
    * Hard, do i full run without killing and or dieing? 
- Gameplay Ideas:
    ** Bullet-Hell : wanted to make one for long time, can easliy fit.
    * Platformer : everything works with platformer.
    * Quake like shooter? : shooter, not that hard to implement.
- Graphics:
    ** Low poly, pixel art style 3d? - didn't try but doesn't look that hard.
    * Low poly, vertex coloring/flat coloring - because of time..
    * 2D, probably can throw something together if needed.
- Music:
    * LOL.
- Sound Effects:
    * sfxr/bfxr. I can't be picky about it.

TODO:
    * add enemy bullet, and maybe custom attacks ( laser? area attack?)
    * make player damage-able (by enemy bullet and maybe if player touch them?)
    * add pickups? health, different shooting style, or some kind of custom special attack
    * add better enemies movement, and different ones for different enemies
    * make levels?
    * need assets, so need to work on it.
    * sound effects
